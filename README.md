# Ivy

Ivy is a higher-level language that allows you to write smart contracts for the Bitcoin protocol. It can compile to instructions for Bitcoinâ€™s virtual machine, Bitcoin Script, and can be used to create SegWit-compatible Bitcoin addresses. Ivy was developed at [Chain](https://chain.com).

You can try out Ivy using the [Ivy Playground for Bitcoin](https://ivy-lang.org/bitcoin), which allows you to create test contracts and try spending them, all in a sandboxed environment.

You can learn more about Ivy and using the Ivy Playground for Bitcoin by reading the [docs](https://docs.ivy-lang.org/bitcoin).

**Ivy is prototype software and is intended for educational purposes only**. Do not attempt to use Ivy to control real Bitcoins.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome; you can create an [issue](https://github.com/ivy-lang/ivy-bitcoin/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/ivy-lang/ivy-bitcoin/pulls) on this repo.
